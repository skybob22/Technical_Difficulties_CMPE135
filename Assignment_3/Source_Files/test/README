New test suites and test files should be added to this directory

#==============================Adding New Tests==============================#
Create a file '[Class_To_Test]Tests.cpp' for clarity
At the top of each file, add the following include and any other necessary:
  > #include "gtest/gtest.h"

Look up information on how to create test cases using gtest [I may add instructions later]

This README file can be removed in assignments copied from this template once at least one file is placed in this directory
